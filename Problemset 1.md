## Problem 12

Paula the painter and her two helpers each paint at constant, but different, rates.  They always start at $\text{8:00 AM}$, and all three always take the same amount of time to eat lunch.  On Monday the three of them painted $50\%$ of a house, quitting at $\text{4:00 PM}$.  On Tuesday, when Paula wasn't there, the two helpers painted only $24\%$ of the house and quit at $\text{2:12 PM}$.
