Hints to problems 12 onwards are on the next page. Try solving the problems first before looking at the hints.

Solutions to this test will be posted on our website at <u>sem-amc-club.tk</u>.





## Hints

#### Problem 12

First find the base-seven representation of 2019. Then look at how you could maximize the sum of the digits for a number less than 2019.





#### Problem 13

What are the possible positions of $x$ in this sequence? What is the median and mean for each position? Equate them and solve for $x$. Don't forget to test if these solutions are extraneous.





#### Problem 14

Remember that $19!$ is divisible by all numbers $n \le 19$. What divisibility tests could you use to make this easier?





#### Problem 17

This problem requires you using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric sequence:
$$
a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \cdots = \frac a{1-r} \qquad\text{(given that $\left|r\right|<1$)}
$$
where $a$ is the first term of the geometric sequence, and $r$ is the common ratio between terms.

If you didn't know this formula before, try solving the problem without reading the rest of the hint.



What is the probability that the green ball lands in bin $1$, and the red ball lands in a bin higher than that? What is the probability of the same thing for bin $2$? Bin $3$? Bin $4$? What is the pattern? How can you add all of these numbers up (remember, there are an infinite number of bins)?
