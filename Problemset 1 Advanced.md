## Problem 9

A year is a leap year if and only if the year number is divisible by $400$ (such as $2000$) or is divisible by $4$ but not by $100$ (such as $2012$).  The $200\text{th}$ anniversary of the birth of novelist Charles Dickens was celebrated on February $7$, $2012$, a Tuesday.  On what day of the week was Dickens born?

## Problem 10

A triangle has area $30$, one side of length $10$, and the median to that side of length $9$.  Let $\theta$ be the acute angle formed by that side and the median.  What is $\sin{\theta}$?

## Problem 11

Alex, Mel, and Chelsea play a game that has $6$ rounds.  In each round there is a single winner, and the outcomes of the rounds are independent.  For each round the probability that Alex wins is $\frac{1}{2}$, and Mel is twice as likely to win as Chelsea.  What is the probability that Alex wins three rounds, Mel wins two rounds, and Chelsea wins one round?

## Problem 12

A power boat and a raft both left dock $A$ on a river and headed downstream. The raft drifted at the speed of the river current. The power boat maintained a constant speed with respect to the river. The power boat reached dock $B$ downriver, then immediately turned and traveled back upriver. It eventually met the raft on the river 9 hours after leaving dock $A.$ How many hours did it take the power boat to go from $A$ to $B?$

\textbf{(B)}\ 3.5 \qquad
\textbf{(C)}\  4 \qquad

## Problem 13

Paula the painter and her two helpers each paint at constant, but different, rates.  They always start at $\text{8:00 AM}$, and all three always take the same amount of time to eat lunch.  On Monday the three of them painted $50\%$ of a house, quitting at $\text{4:00 PM}$.  On Tuesday, when Paula wasn't there, the two helpers painted only $24\%$ of the house and quit at $\text{2:12 PM}$.  On Wednesday Paula worked by herself and finished the house by working until $\text{7:12 PM}$.  How long, in minutes, was each day's lunch break?

## Problem 15

A $3\times3$ square is partitioned into $9$ unit squares.  Each unit square is painted either white or black with each color being equally likely, chosen independently and at random.  The square is then rotated $90^\circ$ clockwise about its center, and every white square in a position formerly occupied by a black square is painted black.  The colors of all other squares are left unchanged.  What is the probability that the grid is now entirely black?
