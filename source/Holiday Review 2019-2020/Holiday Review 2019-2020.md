### Quick tips about the AMC 10

**Timing**: You get 75 minutes for 25 questions, however it is unlikely that you will answer all 25 questions. Budget your time based on your ability (look at last year's scores to see how many questions you answered).

**Scoring**: You earn

- $6$ points for each correct answer
- $1.5$ points for each skipped question
- $0$ points for each incorrect answer

This means you should only guess if you have eliminated at least two answers.

## Algebra

**Warm-up**: What are the formulas for
	a. Sum of an arithmetic series with $n$ terms, with first term $a_1$ and last term $a_n$?
	b. Sum of a geometric series with $n$ terms, with first term $a_1$ and ratio $r$?
	c. Sum of a geometric series with $\infty$ terms, with first term $a_1$ and ratio $-1<r<1$?
