## Combinatorics Answer Key

**Warm-up**:

1. Permutations/Combinations formulas:
   - i. $n^k$
   - ii. $nPk = \dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
   - iii. $\dbinom ck =  nCk=\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
   - iv. $\dbinom{n+k-1}{n-1} = \dbinom{n+k-1}{k}$
   
2. A one-is-to-one correspondence is a mapping between two sets such that every element from the first set is mapped to exactly one element from the second set, and vice versa. For instance, you can form a one-is-to-one correspondence between the sets $\{Su,M,T,W,Th,F,S\}$ and $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$ using the mapping function which takes a day and outputs where it is in the week. Another example of a one-is-to-one correspondence is used in the derivation of the combinations with repetitions formula, where we form a correspondence between combinations of ice cream in a bowl allowing repetitions and permutations of arrows and stars in a line.
   
   If there is a one is to one correspondence $A \lrarr B$ between $A$ and $B$, then the size of $A$ and the size of $B$ are equal ($|A| = |B|$). This means that we can make a one-is-to-one correspondence between a set that is more difficult to count and a set which is easier to count, and then simplify a counting problem.
