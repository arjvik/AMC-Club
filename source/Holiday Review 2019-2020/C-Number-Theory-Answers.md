### Number Theory Answer Key

**Warm-up:**

1. See our notes on SFFT (Lesson 4) at [sem-amc-club.tk/Week4.pdf](https://sem-amc-club.tk/Week4.pdf)

   Solutions are $(0, 3), (1, 1), (3, 0)$

2. Two numbers are coprime if they share no factors other than 1. A good rule of thumb is that $a$ and $b$ are coprime if and only if there exist integers $p$ and $q$ such that $ap+bq=1$.

   - Coprime ($\gcd(2,3)=1$,  $-1\cdot2+1\cdot3=1$)
   - Not coprime ($\gcd(6,8)=2$)
   - Coprime ($\gcd(1,9)=1$,  $1\cdot1+0\cdot9=1$)
   - Not coprime ($gcd(0,5)=5$)

3. See [Euclidean Algorithm](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Euclidean_algorithm#Main_idea_and_Informal_Description) on AoPS.

   Note that $a\cdot b = \gcd(a,b) \cdot \operatorname{lcm}(a,b)$.
