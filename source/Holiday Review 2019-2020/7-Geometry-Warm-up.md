## Geometry Warm-up

1. List all the area formulas you know for a triangle.
   - Use the variables $a,b,c$ for side lengths
   - Use the variables $A,B,C$ for angles
   - Use the variable $s = \frac{a+b+c}2$ for the semiperimeter ($\frac{a+b+c}2$)
   - Use the variable $r$ for the inradius











2. What are the law of sines and cosines?

   
   

   

3. List all similarity and congruence conditions (sometimes called theorems)
