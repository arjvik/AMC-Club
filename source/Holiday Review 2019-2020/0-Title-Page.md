#### How to use this review

This review contains several problems from various areas of math tested on the AMC exam.

Before beginning the problems in a section, look back at any notes you may have on that subject. Check our website ([sem-amc-club.tk](sem-amc-club.tk)) to view old notes packets. For geometry, you may want to skim your notes from your actual geometry class last year.

Try out the warm-up in each section before starting the exercises, and make sure to check your answers. The warm-up contains some important formulas that you should either memorize or be able to derive in a few seconds. These are not the only formulas you will need to know however.

Attempt to solve each problem before looking at the solution. If you are stumped on a problem, take a break and look at it again. Don't jump to reading the solution.

Solve each problem on scratch paper, and be organized with your work, so you can stay organized on the real test.





### Quick tips about the AMC 10

**The Test**: The AMC is made of 25 multiple-choice (5-answer) questions covering a range of topics from algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. You do not get a calculator on the exam.

**Timing**: You get 75 minutes for 25 questions, however it is unlikely that you will answer all 25 questions. Budget your time based on your ability (look at last year's scores to see how many questions you answered).

**Scoring**: You earn

- $6$ points for each correct answer
- $1.5$ points for each skipped question
- $0$ points for each incorrect answer

This means you should only guess if you have eliminated at least two answers.
