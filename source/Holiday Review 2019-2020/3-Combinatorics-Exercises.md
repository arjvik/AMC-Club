3. Two cubical dice each have removable numbers $1$ through $6$. The twelve numbers on the two dice are removed, put into a bag, then drawn one at a time and randomly reattached to the faces of the cubes, one number to each face. The dice are then rolled and the numbers on the two top faces are added. What is the probability that the sum is $7$?

10. Each of 2010 boxes in a line contains a single red marble, and for $1\le k \le 2010$, the box in the $k$th position also contains $k$ white marbles.  Isabella begins at the first box and successively draws a single marble at random from each box, in order. She stops when she first draws a red marble. Let $P(n)$ be the probability that Isabella stops after drawing exactly $n$ marbles. What is the smallest value of $n$ for which $P(n) < \frac1{2010}$?
