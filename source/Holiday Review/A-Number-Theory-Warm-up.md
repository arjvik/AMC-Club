## Number Theory Warm-up

1. What is SFFT (Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick)? Use it to find all non-negative integer solutions $(a, b)$ to $ab+a+b=3$.





2. What does it mean for two numbers to be coprime? Tell if the following numbers are coprime:
   - i. $2, 3$
   - ii. $6,8$
   - iii. $1, 9$
   - iiii. $0,5$





3. What is the euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers? How can you use this to find the LCM?
