## Problem 23

Square $$ABCD$$ in the coordinate plane has vertices at the points $$A(1,1), B(-1,1), C(-1,-1),$$ and $$D(1,-1).$$ Consider the following four transformations:

- $$L,$$ a rotation of $$90^{\circ}$$ counterclockwise around the origin;
- $$R,$$ a rotation of $$90^{\circ}$$ clockwise around the origin;
- $$H,$$ a reflection across the $$x$$-axis; and
- $$V,$$ a reflection across the $$y$$-axis.

Each of these transformations maps the squares onto itself, but the positions of the labeled vertices will change. For example, applying $$R$$ and then $$V$$ would send the vertex $$A$$ at $$(1,1)$$ to $$(-1,-1)$$ and would send the vertex $$B$$ at $$(-1,1)$$ to itself. How many sequences of $$20$$ transformations chosen from $$\{L, R, H, V\}$$ will send all of the labeled vertices back to their original positions? (For example, $$R, R, V, H$$ is one sequence of $$4$$ transformations that will send the vertices back to their original positions.)

$$\displaystyle\textbf{(A)}\ 2^{37} \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 3\cdot 2^{36} \qquad\textbf{(C)}\  2^{38} \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 3\cdot 2^{37} \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 2^{39}$$

## Problem 24

How many positive integers $$n$$ satisfy
$$
\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor?

(Recall that $$\lfloor x\rfloor$$ is the greatest integer not exceeding $$x$$.)

$$\textbf{(A) } 2 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 4 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 6 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 30 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 32$$

## Problem 25

Let $$D(n)$$ denote the number of ways of writing the positive integer $$n$$ as a product
$$
n = f_1\cdot f_2\cdots f_k,
$$
where $$k\ge1$$, the $$f_i$$ are integers strictly greater than $$1$$, and the order in which the factors are listed matters (that is, two representations that differ only in the order of the factors are counted as distinct). For example, the number $$6$$ can be written as $$6$$, $$2\cdot 3$$, and $$3\cdot2$$, so $$D(6) = 3$$. What is $$D(96)$$?

$$\textbf{(A) } 112 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 128 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 144 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 172 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 184$$
