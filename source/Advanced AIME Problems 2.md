1. Find the number of five-digit positive integers, $n$, that satisfy the following conditions:
   - The number $n$ is divisible by $5$
   - The first and last digits of $n$ are equal
   - The sum of the digits of $n$ is divisible by $5$












2. Let $ABCD$ be a square, and let $E$ and $F$ be points on $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{BC},$ respectively. The line through $E$ parallel to $\overline{BC}$ and the line through $F$ parallel to $\overline{AB}$ divide $ABCD$ into two squares and two nonsquare rectangles. The sum of the areas of the two squares is $\frac{9}{10}$ of the area of square $ABCD.$ Find $\dfrac{AE}{EB} + \dfrac{EB}{AE}.$ *(Source: 2013 AIME 1 #3)*














3. In the array of $13$ squares shown below, $8$ squares are colored red, and the remaining $5$ squares are colored blue. If one of all possible such colorings is chosen at random, the probability that the chosen colored array appears the same when rotated $90^{\circ}$ around the central square is $\dfrac{1}{n}$ , where $n$ is a positive integer. Find $n$. *(Source: 2013 AIME 1 #4)*

4. The real root of the equation $8x^3-3x^2-3x-1=0$ can be written in the form $\dfrac{\sqrt[3]{a}+\sqrt[3]{b}+1}{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers. Find $a+b+c$. *(Source: 2013 AIME 1 #5)*






























5. Let $\bigtriangleup PQR$ be a triangle with $\angle P = 75^\circ$ and $\angle Q = 60^\circ$. A regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ with side length $1$ is drawn inside $\triangle PQR$ so that side $\overline{AB}$ lies on $\overline{PQ}$, side $\overline{CD}$ lies on $\overline{QR}$, and one of the remaining vertices lies on $\overline{RP}$. There are positive integers $a, b, c, $ and $d$ such that the area of $\triangle PQR$ can be expressed in the form $\dfrac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a$ and $d$ are relatively prime, and c is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c+d$. *(Source: 2013 AIME 1 #12)*
